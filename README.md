# Prism

**The confidential-compliance layer for real-world assets on Stellar.**

Prism is a composable ZK SDK for Soroban — an anonymous-membership + nullifier core
(the "Semaphore Stellar doesn't have") plus three differentiators: a **proof-aggregation
coprocessor** (N→1), **omnichain nullifiers** (EVM↔Stellar), and **standard-native
selective disclosure** (SEP-57 / confidential-token).

> One ray of light enters, a full spectrum comes out — one ZK primitive in, a spectrum
> of problems solved out.

Canonical proof system: **Groth16 over BN254**, verified on-chain with Soroban's native
BN254 host functions (Protocol 25/26). Full design: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Benchmarks — receipts

The load-bearing constraint is Soroban's **~100M instruction ceiling per contract call**.
A single Groth16/BN254 verify measures **~28.8M instructions on testnet** (Protocol 26);
naive N-verify blows past 100M at **N = 4**; the Aggregator's job is N→1 (one ~28.8M
verify regardless of N).

**Aggregator — one verify settles K memberships, flat in K.** Because the aggregation
circuit exposes a *constant* 3 public signals `[H, root, externalNullifier]` regardless of
K, the on-chain verify cost is flat while naive per-proof verification is K× and breaks the
ceiling at **K=4**:

| K | Prism: 1 verify (CPU insns) | Naive: K verifies | Naive fits <100M? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 26,619,054 | 26,619,054 | ✅ |
| 2 | 26,619,054 | 53,238,108 | ✅ |
| 4 | 26,619,054 | 106,476,216 | ❌ **exceeds ceiling** |
| 8 | 26,619,054 | 212,952,432 | ✅ Prism / ❌ naive |

Single Groth16/BN254 verify also measured on testnet via RPC `simulateTransaction`
(decoded `SorobanTransactionData.resources.instructions`) at **28,822,880** instructions,
~38,819 stroops (~0.0039 XLM).

_Native `cargo test` CPU counts (above) underestimate WASM; testnet simulation is the
authoritative figure. The K-table is from the `verify_cost_is_flat_in_k` bench — spread
across K is **zero**. **Aggregation-by-batching; recursive folding (Nova/ProtoStar) is
deferred to SCF.**_

## Deployment (Stellar testnet, Protocol 26)

The **Aggregator milestone** — one on-chain Groth16/BN254 verify settled **K=8** memberships
in a single transaction (`Settled count: 8`):

| Contract | Address |
|---|---|
| aggregator | `CCTYJUKHHCYHI6MT4EQLCL7P5UQTSVZWT6NJAZ7TSLHIN6QYGYACA76C` |
| verifier-registry | `CDT4FU2JVI2JWBKMBHVQSEYTG7L7DXXU2NRHVKDQFC2XFHRFMS6Z7PQ2` |
| commitment-tree | `CAUMBMTTWILMQTYL2LY3QEWWAE6C7GBPHVU4BJT44M4U56XNLMBLE7X6` |
| nullifier-registry | `CDXWKWSSAVXNU3R67T5VYSJDKQBWA6JTCFHMQBDSA52KCJ7PRQMP64UL` |

| Receipt | Value |
|---|---|
| K=8 aggregated settle tx | `bfeec9d01ab59f93b6f67a27d9db42dc0ca2655a0027d74f56464d7a0abe80cf` |
| Settle instructions (testnet sim) | **42,084,162** (1 verify + 8-deep H-fold + 8 nullifier writes) |
| Return value | `8` (memberships settled) · all 8 nullifiers now `is_spent` |
| On-chain tree root | `02eda5…467a0d` — **equals the circuit's root** (no mock) |
| Deployer | `GBOHXV4AO7QHS4MMVERDLEVVMPSFE6S5E5SBWDFE3SVW3ZLTUBWMQNSA` |

The **Disclosure milestone** — settle privately, prove specifics to an auditor:

| Contract | Address |
|---|---|
| disclosure | `CBBUNBBZAQBQUNVCZTGD4KUJCRO5T6Z24P3H3IAUHHPL6CBNGRINCAHU` |
| asp (association-set provider) | `CAIK3JUGJ5QEGNHAKWC7CEJGXDB53DPYMQW5GLB4Q3UEO3UJPLTUUS2C` |

| Receipt | Value |
|---|---|
| `put_note` txs (proof verified on-chain) | `24e038a5…562b`, `597f1e60…bf1b`, `dd3e6263…aa83` |
| `put_note` instructions (testnet sim) | **30,320,716** (one disclosure-correctness verify + store) |
| What the chain shows | only `(R, ciphertext)` per note — **no amounts** |
| What the auditor sees | decrypts on-chain ciphertexts → `[4.2M, 1.75M, 3.05M]`, predicate `total == 9,000,000` **PASS** |

The **Omnichain milestone** — a nullifier spent on EVM is rejected on Stellar:

| Contract (fresh stack) | Address |
|---|---|
| omnichain-mirror | `CBWF6BC2JULCVNE3SLRAIVJWASCSQPIGQOF6BYRKTPUQSDEESAPWLSSI` |
| aggregator (mirror-wired) | `CARP3XNCYQPRPETRJUKE7D5NLDXDNYTL2CK7RAMTI32NXS2YOULTPO6C` |

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| Relayer syncs EVM-spent nullifier → mirror (sync tx) | `ba047b1570e8688c8beffcf698e8a7346c21d65b631d908846ca772cf6b17d70` |
| Settle identity **A** (spent on EVM) | **BLOCKED** — `Error(Contract, #9) ForeignSpent`; A *not* spent on Stellar |
| Settle identity **B** (fresh) | **SUCCESS** — `Settled count: 1`, tx `2be458808641f8c56ac98ea53d7aa8adc01736828e0d03c3e37cdf4fa1ce6daa` |

**Why it matters, two ways:** (1) **cross-chain Sybil resistance** — the same identity can't
double-claim across EVM and Stellar; (2) a **bridge that brings EVM ZK developers** (and their
BN254 circuits) onto Stellar unchanged. **Trust (this milestone):** the relayer is TRUSTED
(attestation mode); the EVM source is a labeled mock. **SCF:** replace the relayer with on-chain
verification of a succinct proof of EVM state against the mirror's `foreign_root` (BN254/EVM parity).

Day-1 single-verify contract `CBSUNYX74ZJYRAIEB5WQN4QBDMDXKO7NKVDGLYNZCHC2PZ5N4STX4DBF`
(verify tx `ae7324c2…ac6fac`) remains live.

Reproduce: `circuits/` → `pnpm install && bash scripts/aggregate_build.sh && bash scripts/disclosure_build.sh && node scripts/export_agg_fixtures_rs.mjs`;
`contracts/` → `cargo test -- --nocapture`; SDK demo → `cd packages/sdk && node src/auditor-demo.ts`.

## Selective disclosure → SEP-57 / confidential-token mapping

Prism is the **ZK confidential+disclosure module a regulated-asset issuer plugs in** — not a
generic view key. Mapping to the SEP-57 / ERC-7984-style confidential-token interface:

- **Issuer onboarding** = register the auditor/regulator's **viewing key** (`disclosure.register_auditor`) and admit participants via the **ASP** (`asp.set_allowed`, then `asp.approve_root`).
- **Confidential settlement** = the Aggregator settles K transfers under one proof; `settle()` enforces `asp.is_approved_root` (compliance gate) — amounts never hit the chain.
- **Selective disclosure** = each note's amount is encrypted to the auditor key (Baby Jubjub ECDH + Poseidon); `disclosure.put_note` accepts it **only with a disclosure-correctness proof** binding the ciphertext to the committed amount, so the auditor's later decryption is trustworthy. The regulator runs `prism.disclose(viewKey, predicate)` for `total == X` / `all ≤ cap` — predicate disclosure, not full de-shielding.

**Scope this milestone:** the **amount** is bound in-circuit (the soundness-critical field);
counterparty/memo are encrypted SDK-side but not yet bound in-circuit. Auditor decryption +
predicate checks run off-chain (the standard view-key model). Folding/aggregation of disclosure
proofs and full SEP-57 wire-format binding are SCF items.

|---|---|
| verifier-registry (Groth16/BN254) | **REAL** — deployed + verifying on testnet |
| commitment-tree (incremental Merkle, Poseidon) | **REAL** — deployed; on-chain root == circuit root |
| nullifier-registry (atomic + all-or-nothing batch) | **REAL** — deployed on testnet |
| aggregator (K→1) | **REAL** — K=8 settled on testnet in one verify |
| poseidon (circomlib-compatible, BN254) | **REAL** — matches circomlib test vector |
| membership + aggregation + disclosure circuits + trusted setup | **REAL** — Circom 2, Hermez ptau, snarkjs |
| disclosure (encrypted note + on-chain correctness proof) | **REAL** — deployed; 3 notes stored on testnet, auditor decrypts |
| asp (allow/deny + approved roots) | **REAL** — deployed; gates `settle()` |
| SDK selective disclosure (`encryptNote`, `prism.disclose`) | **REAL** — Baby Jubjub ECDH + Poseidon; auditor demo runs |
| omnichain-mirror + settle foreign-spent gate | **REAL** — deployed; EVM-spent identity blocked on testnet |
| relayer: Stellar posting | **REAL** (stellar-cli) — EVM source is a labeled **MOCK** |
| demo dapp (UI) | not started |

_Updated as milestones land. Honesty over polish — mocks are labeled. Tree/nullifier/ASP
mutations are permissionless this milestone (operator-gating is a hardening TODO). Auditor
decryption + predicate checks are off-chain (view-key model); counterparty/memo not yet
bound in-circuit._
